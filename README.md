A basic telegram bot made using python and its library namely "python-telegram-bot".
1. Created bot manually on telegram using telegram id @BotFather, which created a bot for me and gave me an API key for me to be able to control it.
2. Wrote a python script using "python-telegram-bot" and added a few basic commands and handlers associated with it.
3. Used "dotenv" module in order to hide my API key and keep it secure by having it locally.

NOTE-1: My bot's username is @sithhbot 
NOTE-2: Since i host it locally my bot is not up for most of the time if you want to try it ping me on telegram @amowaisusmani and i could bring it up for a few.
